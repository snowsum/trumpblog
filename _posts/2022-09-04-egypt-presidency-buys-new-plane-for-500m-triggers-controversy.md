The Egyptian president has purchased a new presidential jumbo jet at the cost of $500 million, triggering fierce debate on social media over the timing of the purchase, which comes amidst a severe economic crisis.

Egypt has been struggling to generate foreign currency for imports and to tackle inflation, which has been hitting the country hard for years.

Egypt has acquired a Boeing 747-8 aircraft, seen last week in Shannon in Ireland, where it was undergoing painting work by International Aerospace Coatings (IAC).

In 2020,  [_Simple Flying_](https://simpleflying.com/egyptian-boeing-747-shannon-painting/)_,_  an aviation news website, reported that German airliner Lufthansa sold one of its Boeing 747-8 passenger planes to an "unidentified customer".

The website revealed that the 747-8 jet would become an Egyptian executive aircraft, taking SU-GGG registration.

Egyptian media reported the deal to  [buy the Boeing 747-8 aircraft at almost $500 million](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/egypt-new-presidential-plane-receive), while the Egyptian presidency counter-stated that it does not need such a plane.

Egyptian journalist and MP Mustafa Al-Bakri condemned the reports about the purchase as "propaganda" of the Muslim Brotherhood.

He claimed that the aircraft was bought for no more than $240 million, noting that this came following a report by Boeing that the current 28-year-old presidential Airbus A340 would be unfit for use by 2023.

Egyptian expert of Constitutional Law Nour Farahat said that Egyptians would accept the narrative of Al-Bakri should he prove his claims by providing the public with a report from Boeing about the expiry of the presidential plane, as well as details about the purchase of the new one.
