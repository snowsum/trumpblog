##### Brandy Bottone's first citation was dismissed before she was pulled over a second time for the same violation.
A pregnant Texas woman who claimed she was entitled to drive in a high occupancy vehicle lane because of her unborn child  [received another ticket for the same offense](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/pregnant-hov-lane-mom-gets-first-ticket-dismissed-then-gets-another/3060581/), authorities said Tuesday.

Brandy Bottone, a 32-year-old Plano resident, became an unlikely focal point of the nation's post-Roe debate after she was pulled over  [in a carpool lane June 29](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pregnant-texas-woman-says-unborn-baby-count-car-passenger-receiving-ho-rcna37531).

A sheriff's deputy cited her for driving alone in the HOV lane that requires drivers to have at least one other person in the car — and Bottone claimed that the one other person was the unborn child in her womb.

She insisted that with the  [U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-wipes-away-constitutional-guarantee-abortion-rights-over-rcna18718)  on June 24, her unborn child now was recognized as a living person.

Her argument was apparently good enough to win a dismissal. It wasn't immediately clear if that second ticket, picked up Aug. 3, would also be kicked out.

"Yes, Ms. Bottone’s HOV case was dismissed," a Dallas County district attorney's representative said in a statement to NBC News. "The defendant received a second HOV citation about a month after the first. This second citation is currently pending."

Bottone did not return several phone calls, emails and text messages Tuesday and Wednesday seeking her comment.

She  [told the Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/watchdog/2022/08/29/pregnant-hov-lane-mom-gets-first-ticket-dismissed-then-gets-another/)  on Sunday that the second HOV pullover happened on U.S. Highway 75 South near Midpark Road and the deputy knew exactly who she was.

“You again?” Bottone quoted the deputy as saying.

“So, when are you going to have this baby?” the deputy allegedly asked.

“Tomorrow,” Bottone said she answered.

“Oh, good luck,” she quoted the deputy as saying before issuing her the ticket.

Bottone has since  [given birth to a girl](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg9QA1fua_H/), the paper reported.
