Volodymyr Zelensky issued a warning to Russian forces during his evening address on Monday, saying it was time for them to "run away, go home."

Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN)As  [Ukraine](https://cnn.com/2022/08/29/politics/ukraine-shaping-counteroffensive/index.html)  ramps up its offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the country's south, its forces have regained four villages and broken through Russian defenses at multiple points of the frontline in the  [Kherson region](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/politics/ukraine-shaping-counteroffensive/index.html), according to Ukrainian officials.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky also issued a warning to Russian forces during his evening address Monday, saying it was time for them to "run away, go home," and that "the occupiers must know we will chase them to the border."

Yet one of his advisers cautioned that the operation will be a slow one, that would "grind the enemy."

"This process will not be very fast," Oleksiy Arestovych, adviser to the head of the office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement posted on Telegram late Monday, "but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine."

"[The Ukrainian Armed Forces] have broken through the frontline in several sectors," Arestovych said in a video interview posted on YouTube, adding that Ukrainian forces were shelling ferry crossing points that Moscow is using to resupply Russian-occupied territory over the Dnipro River in the Kherson region.

"We suppress their attempts to supply their groups on the west bank [of the Dnipro]," he said. "We strike at reserves, including reserves that are on the east bank and are trying to cross."
